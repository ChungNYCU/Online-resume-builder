    I have quit my job as an assistant business manager and given up a few opportunities at local investment banks to
    start this new venture. Having tried numerous positions in different sectors ranging from insurance to retail,
    I have yet to find the motivation and fulfillment to wake up on a Monday morning. It is until I have voluntarily
    joined a data protection development project during my free time, I have discovered my interest in computer science
    and programming. Starting from learning basics, I am entirely determined but, at the same time, excited about this
    new challenge.

    job applications and coding practise. I have experience coding mainly
    in java and C++. I do not have much on-hand coding experience but
    I am a fast learner and can find out the solutions quickly.
