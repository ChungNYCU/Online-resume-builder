    I enjoy a nice cup of coffee in a sunny day to help me battle with
    job applications and coding practise. I have experience coding mainly
    in java and C++. I do not have much on-hand coding experience but
    I am a fast learner and can find out the solutions quickly.

<h3>Wei-Che Chung (Jesse)</h3>

    I am extremely motivated to solve technical puzzles and always sharpen my skill.
    I am confident in my research ability at the same time I have diverse
    coding experience so that no matter what the situation,
    I can get into work proficiently.

    Of the three titles, I am most proud of my work as a software developer.
    I have experience working with labs making software for their PCR and MicroCycler as well as inventory systems.
    I have a Maltipoo with abandonment issues and greatly enjoyed staying at home during Covid.
